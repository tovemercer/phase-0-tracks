Release 0

Gain a high-level understanding what jQuery is and what it can do
before -> having a historical understanding of the programs lets me see the big picture of what it can do (wikipedia).
after -> didn't get as much from this as i thought... i ended up looking up most of the references they used to describe what jQuery did. i suppose it wasn't basic enough, haha.

Find a cheat sheet
before -> reference guide to be able to come back and look at.
after -> i found one that i think will come in handy although it doesn't make a whole lot on sense right now.

Video tutorial demonstration
before -> i tend to learn better with visual demonstrations vs reading about a topic. i can follow along with the video and learn by imitation
after -> spend most of my time watching video tutorials, and i feel like i got a lot of out it. i learn better through visuals and hands-on so this helped a lot in seeing a live example.

Play around with the basic functions of jQuery
before -> after feeling comfortable with the basics, jumping in a figuring it out with hands on experience
after -> didn't get to this part... watching videos too up most of my time.
