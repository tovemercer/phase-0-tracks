2. What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

GET and POST are different types of HTTP requests.

GET is used to retrieve remote specified data. It requests a representation of the specified resource and should not be used for operations that cause side-effects. 

POST is used to insert and/or update remote specified data. It submits data to be processed from an HTML form to the identified resource; the data is included in the body of the request which may result in the creation of a new resource, update the existing resource or both. 


Optional bonus question: 
What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

A web cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser. They are used by websites to remember the user's information or to record the user's browser activity.
