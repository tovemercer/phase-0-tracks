You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT b.First_name, b.last_name, a.name, c.stars, c.comment
   ...> FROM business a
   ...> INNER JOIN reviews c
   ...> ON a.id=c.business_id
   ...> INNER JOIN users b
   ...> ON b.id=c.users_id;

sqlite> ER JOIN reviews c


How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

sqlite> SELECT b.First_name, b.last_name, a.name, c.stars, c.comment
   ...> FROM business a
   ...> INNER JOIN reviews c
   ...> ON a.id=c.business_id
   ...> INNER JOIN users b
   ...> ON b.id=c.users_id
   ...> WHERE a.id=1;
