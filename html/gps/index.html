<p>The purpose of the HTML5 semanntic tags are to assit those with disabilites by making the page more readable. The nav, header and footer seem the most useful.</p>
<p>HTML will load first, then the page is read from top to bottom.</p>
<p>We learned how to create unique snippets. I could see being able to create personalized snippets very useful. I'm sure we'll have plenty of oppertunities to create them.</p>
<p>The Semantic elements. I don't yet understand what they are and how they are different than the ones we've already been using. They seen redundant. I get that they are to make pages more readable for those with disabilities I just don't understand the need.</p>
