* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
version control allows you to save your progress and allows you go go back to a save point if needed. it is useful if you are needing to 'go back in time' to a earlier version of your code.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
a branch is a copy of the master that you can work on so so the master is left untouched in case an error is made. it allows you to work on code and be albe to go back to the original if needed.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
a commit, commits your changes to the branch. before you can commit in a repository you have to add it then commit. a good commit message is descriptive telling you what changes were made.

* What is a merge conflict?
a merge conflict is when two or more people have been working in a sharded repository and multiple peole have changed the same line of code. the merge conflict will occur and you need to go and select one of the changes or change it to include both.
